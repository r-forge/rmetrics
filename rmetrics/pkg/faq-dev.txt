- Why are you using \dontrun{} command in examples?

  The \dontrun tag in examples is or may be important in
  the following situations:

  The CRAN installation cannot check and run examples
  when there is an internet access, it breaks installation in Vienna!
  So \dontrun is essential in the manual pages for the commands
  *Import and *Series with Internet.

  All plot functions where the which="ask" argument ist set must
  have a \dontrun. These examples are showing the users how
  to use interactive plot tools. However if they are active  in
  examples, they stop installation and package building
  process on the CRAN server waiting for an interactive response.

  All examples with tcl/tk are not allowed to run, they produce also
  problems on the CRAN server.
