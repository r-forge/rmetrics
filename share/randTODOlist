====== randtoolbox: TODO list ======

(order/numbers mean nothing)

=== short term ===

1. Add the character representation to the R interface of congruRand.
  Then, for example, the user may specify the modulus 2^64 in R
  as "18446744073709551616" and state, e.g. "12345678901234567890".
  Character representation is the simplest solution, if we want
  to allow moduli, which are powers of 2 larger than 2^53 and allow
  to set any initial state of such a generator from the R level.

2. Add further recurrences for congruRand into the C code. Currently,
  we have the recurrence
     congru_seed  = (mult * congru_seed + incr) % mod
  If mod = 2^k then
     congru_seed  = (mult * congru_seed + incr) & mask
  with mask = 2^k - 1 is faster. If mod = 2^64, then even
     congru_seed  = (mult * congru_seed + incr)
  is sufficient.

3. Add runif() interface for WELL generators. Currently, it is implemented
  only for congruRand.

8. add a global man page ?randtoolbox like the ChainLadder package.

9. rewrite the vignette with two chapter, the first one will be a short
  introduction while the second one will a deep and exhaustive presentation
  of all the tools in randtoolbox.

=== long term ===

4. Allow seeding of WELL generators by a seed, which is a vector of
  arbitray length. The typical usage would use a vector of length
  between, say, 3 and 10. In this way, much larger number of initial
  states are available than if the seed is just a single 32 bit number.
  A working prototype is contained in rngwell19937 as set.vector.seed().
  It may be proved that seeding by any two different vectors of length
  at most 3 leads to a different initial state. I am now trying to 
  extend the proof to length 4. On the other hand, in length 10, we
  get collisions (different seeds leading to the same initial state),
  but it is quite hard to find them. Similarity of bit patterns is
  irrelevant here (does not help to find collisions). This is important
  since this allows to get rid of the traditional suggestion for seeds:
  "use numbers with sufficiently random bit patterns, in particular, not 0".
  Using MRG32k5a for initialization allows that any seed is good.
  There is no problem to use, for example, seeds 0, 1, 2, ...
  since they produce completely different sequences.

5. Add runif() interface to all generators.

6. implement the spectral test (only for LCG?) with the code available
on http://random.mat.sbg.ac.at/results/karl/spectraltest . there might be some licence problems.

7. implement the Wichman Hill RNG of 2006. paper available here 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V8V-4K7F86W-2/2/a3a33291b8264e4c882a8f21b6e43351 . 
implementation may be found on the web.
