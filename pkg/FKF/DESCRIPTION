LazyLoad: yes
Depends:  R(>= 2.8)
Description: This is a fast and flexible implementation of the Kalman filter, which can deal with NAs. It is entirely written in C and relies fully on linear algebra subroutines contained in BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the filter, the fitting of high-dimensional linear state space models to large datasets becomes possible. This package also contains a plot function for the visualization of the state vector and graphical diagnostics of the residuals.
