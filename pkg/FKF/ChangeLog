FKF V0.1.0
	* NA-values in the vector of response variables yt are now
	supported. In the filter recursions the observation vector yt
	with missing values will be reduced to the vector yt* without
	missing values and the measurement equation will be adjusted
	accordingly.

FKF V0.0.3
	* c-function 'cfkf': Warning for non-finite 'logDet' or
	'mahalanobis' removed (too verbose as information is contained in
	the output 'status' and also documented). Potential warnings
	occurring in the Cholesky factorization are more informative now.

FKF V0.0.2
	* Minor corrections in the documentation.
	* Function 'fkf' scans for missing arguments now.
