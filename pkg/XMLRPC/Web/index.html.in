<p>
This package provides an implementation of XML-RPC, a
relatively simple remote procedure call mechanism
that uses HTTP and XML.  This can be used for
communicating between processes on a single machine
or for accessing Web services from within R.

<p>
One illustration of this package is the
<a href="../RUbigraph">RUbigraph</a> package
that  sends instructions from R to an Ubigraph
server running on the same or a different machine
and which draws a dynamic, interactive graph.


<h2>The Software</h2>

The primary (and only) function is <code>xml.rpc</code> and this is
used to make a method call and specify zero or more arguments.
There are numerous internal functions that implement the details
of marshalling objects between the both sides of the interface.
