<h2>timeDate Class</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A collection and description of functions and methods
for managing date and time around the globe for any 
financial center. The concept allows for dealing
with several time zones at the same time, day light 
saving time and holiday calendars independently of the 
date and time specifications of the operating system 
implemented on a specific computer.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
For the management of chronological objects under R three concepts 
are available: The first is the implementation of date and time in R's 
<code>chron</code> package neglecting locals, time zones and day light saving 
times. This approach is appropriate for economic time series. The second 
approach, available in R's base package implements the POSIX standard 
to date and time objects, named <code>"POSIXt"</code>. Unfortunately, the 
representation of these objects is operating system dependent and 
especially under MS Windows several problems appear in the management 
of time zones and day light saving times. Here we present a solution
to overcome these difficulties with POSIX objects and introduce a 
new S4 class of 'timeDate' objects which allow for powerful methods 
to represent dates and times in different financial centers around 
the world. Many of the basic functionalities of these objects are in 
common with S-Plus' <code>timeDate</code> objects and thus many of your 
privately written functions for <code>FinMetrics</code> may also be used 
within R's environment.
</p>
<p>
A major difference is the time zone concept which is replaced by the
"Financial Center" concept. The <code>FinCenter</code> character variable
specifies where you are living and at which financial center you are
working. With the variable <code>myFinCenter</code> you can overwrite the
default setting with your personal settings.  
With the specification of the <code>FinCenter</code> your system knows what
rules rules for day light saving times should be applied, what is your
holiday calendar, what are your interest rate conventions. (Not all
specifications are already implemented.) Many other 
aspects can be easily accessed when a financial center is named. So we 
can distinguish between Frankfurt and Zurich, which both belong to the 
same time zone, but differed in DST changes in the eighties and have
different holiday calendars. Futhermore, since the underlying time 
refers to "GMT" and DST rules and all other information is available 
in local (ASCII) databases, we are sure, that R delivers with such a 
date/time concept on every computer independent of the operating system 
in use, identical results. 
</p>
<p>
Another important feature of the <code>"timeDate"</code> concept used here is 
the fact that we don't rely on American or European ways to write dates.
We use consequently the ISO-8601 standard for date and time notations.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Financial Centers</B>
<br><br>
There are two functions concerned with the financial centers. The 
first, <code>rulesFinCenter</code>, lists the daylight saving rules for a 
selected financial center, and the second, <code>listFinCenter</code>, 
lists all centers available in the database. There is no dependency 
on the POSIX implementation of your operating system because all 
time zone and day light saving time information is stored locally 
in ASCII files. It is important to say, that the <code>TZ</code> environment 
variable must set to <code>"GMT"</code> in your system environment that 
there are no conflicts with the POSIX time zone management.
</p>
<p>
Through the definition of financial centers it becomes possible to 
introduce in the future a specification structure for financial
centers, which includes further information for a center like
holiday calendars, currency and interest rate conventions or many
others.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Generation of timeDate Objects</B>
<br><br>
We have defined a 'timeDate' class which is in many aspects similar
to the S-Plus class with the same name, but has also some important
advantageous differeneces. The S4 class has four Slots, the <code>Data</code> 
slot which holds date and time as 'POSIXlt' objects in the standard
ISO-8601 format, the <code>Dim</code> slot which gives the dimension
of the data object, the <code>format</code> specification slot and the
<code>FinCenter</code> slot which holds the name of the financial center. 
</p>
<p>
Three functions allow to cgenerate date/time objects: <code>timeDate</code> 
from character vectors, <code>timeCalendar</code> from date and time atoms, 
and <code>timeSequence</code> from a "from/to" or from a "from/length" sequence 
specification. Note, time zone transformations are easily handled by
by the <code>timeDate</code> functions which can also take <code>timeDate</code> 
and <code>POSIXt</code> objects as inputs, while transforming them between 
financial centers and/or time zones specified by the arguments <code>zone</code> 
and <code>FinCenter</code>. Finally the function <code>Sys.timeDate</code> returns 
current system time in form of a <code>timeDate</code> object.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Tests and Representation of timeDate Objects:</B>
<br><br>
We have implemented four methods to test and represent
<code>timeDate</code> objects. The method <code>is.timeDate</code> checks if 
a given object is of class <code>"timeDate"</code>. The print method 
returns the date/time in square <code>"[]"</code> brackets to dsitinguish
the output from other date and time objects. On top of the date and
time output the name of the <code>FinCenter</code> is printed. The summary 
method returns a printed report with information about the 
<code>"timeDate"</code> object. Finally, the format methods allows to 
transform objects into a ISO conform formatted character strings.
</p>
<p>
<B>Mathematical Operations:</B>
<br><br>
This is a collection of S3 methods for objects of class <code>timeDate</code>
to perform mathematical operations. Included are methods to extracts 
or replace subsets from <code>timeDate</code> objects, to perform arithmetic 
<code>"+"</code> and <code>"-"</code> operations, to group 'Ops' generic functions, 
to return suitably lagged and iterated differences, to return differences 
of two <code>timeDate</code> objects, to concatenate objects, to replicate 
objects, to rounds objects, to truncates objects, to extract the first 
or last entry of a vector, to sort the objects of the elements of a 
date/time vector, and to revert <code>timeDate</code> vector objects.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Transformation of Objects:</B>
<br><br>
This is a collection of S3 methods for objects of class <code>timeDate</code>
to transform those objects between different representations.
Included are methods to transform <code>timeDate</code> objects to character 
strings, to data frames, to POSIXct or POSIXlt objects, to Julian
counts, to extract date/time atoms from calendar dates, and to 
extract the months atom from a <code>timeDate</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>

lists time zones available in the database.
<br>
<br>
<code>timedate</code><br>
<code>timeCalendar</code><br>
<code>timeSequence</code>
<br>
return a S4 object of class 'timeDate'.
<br>
<br>
<code>Sys.timeDate</code>
<br>
returns the system time as an object of class 'timeDate'.
<br>
<br>
<code>is.timeDate</code>
<br>

argument is of <code>timeDate</code> type or not.
<br>
<br>
<EM>print</EM>
<br>

<code>timeDate</code> object.
<br>
<br>
<EM>summary</EM>
<br>

object. This includes the starting and end date, the number of 
dates the format and financial center in use.
<br>
<br>
<EM>format</EM>
<br>
returns an ISO conform formatted character string.
<br></p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
originally, these functions were written for Rmetrics users using R and 
Rmetrics under Microsoft's Windows XP operating system where time zones, 
daylight saving times and holiday calendars are not or insuffeciently 
supported. The functions are untested for other system environments, 
but may be used.
</p>
<p>
The usage of the Ical Library and the introduction of the FinCenter
concept was originally develloped for R Version 1.5. The 
<code>timeDate</code> and <code>timeSeries</code> objects were added for 
R Version 1.8.1. Minor changes were made to adapt the functions 
for R Version 1.9.1. As a consequence, newer concepts like the 
<code>Date</code> objects were not yet considered and included in this 
collection of date and time concepts. With R Version 2.3.0 a major
update has been made adding many new generic functions and renaming 
a few already existing functions, please be aware of this. 
</p>
<p>
Note, the date/time conversion from an arbitry timezone to GMT cannot
be unique, since date/time objects appear twice during the hour
when DST changes. A bookkeeping which takes care if DST is effective 
or not is not yet included. However, in most applications this is 
not necessary since the markets are closed on weekends, especially 
at times when DST usually changes. It is planned for the future to
implement the DST change properly.
</p>
<p>
The ISO-8601 midnight standard has been implemented. Note, that for
example "2005-01-01 24:00:00" is a valid date/time string.
</p>
<p>
Beside the examples given in the manual pages additional demo and
test files are available with much more examples including also those
from the book of Zivot and Wang (2003).
