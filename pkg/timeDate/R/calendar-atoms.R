    ##
    ##    if you wonder why this works, see my comments in .formatFinCenterNum(). Indeed, it
    ##    looks peculiar since the date at GMT may be different from the date at FinCenter!
    ##
    ##    To summarize, .formatFinCenterNum() computes (with "gmt2any") a GMT time which will
    ##    print the same as the time of x in FinCenter. as.POSIXlt() calls
    ##    .formatFinCenterNum() indirectly, so the same holds for it.
    ##
    ## TODO: due to the above, the timeDate methods for as.POSIXlt and as.POSIXct are
    ##       misleading, they do something somewhat different. Since this seems to be used at
    ##       a number of places in timeDate, it is not straightforward to fix this (assuming
    ##       I am correct). One way would be to create a new generic with a slightly
    ##       different name, maybe not exported, with methods the current methods for
    ##       as.POSIXlt and as.POSIXct, then rename the calls in the package to use that (for
    ##       example, the one below). When everything is sorted out the as.POSIXlt and
    ##       as.POSIXct methods can be fixed.
