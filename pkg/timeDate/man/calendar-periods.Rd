\usage{
periods(x, period = "12m", by = "1m", offset = "0d")
periodicallyRolling(x, period = "52w", by = "4w", offset = "0d")
monthlyRolling(x, period = "12m", by = "1m")
}


\arguments{

    \item{x}{
        an object of class timeDate.
    }

    \item{period}{
        a span string, consisting of a length integer
        and a unit value, e.g. "52w" for 52 weeks.}
    \item{by}{

    }
    \item{offset}{

\examples{
## Create Time Sequence -
   x <- timeSequence(from = "2001-01-01", to = "2009-01-01", by = "day")

## Generate Periods -
   periods(x, "12m", "1m")
   periods(x, "52w", "4w")

## Roll Periodically -
   periodicallyRolling(x)

## Roll Monthly -
   monthlyRolling(x)
