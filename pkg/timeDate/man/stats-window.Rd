\note{

  % :TODO:
  
  The method for \code{cut} has been discouraged in the sources for a
  long time (with a recommendation to use \code{window}). It was
  officially deprecated in v4032.109 and will be removed or replaced by
  a method that is consistent with the methods for \code{cut} in base R,
