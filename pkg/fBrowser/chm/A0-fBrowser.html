<h2>Rmetrics Browser and Graphical User Interface</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A browser and graphical user interface for the Rmetrics packages.
<br>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre> 
fBrowser()
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
We have created a browser and graphical user interfaces for the
Rmetrics packages to better support teaching in financial engineering
and computation finance. The GUI is started from the R console by 
the command <code>fBrowser()</code>, the rest is self-explaining.
</p>
<p>
The GUI is divided into three major parts: on top a menu bar, in 
the middle a text window for the output, and on the bottom an info 
bar with five text fields.
</p>
<p>
The menu bar on top has currently 7 Popup menus including <br>
File, fBasics/fCalendar, fSeries, fMultivar, fExtremes, fOptions, Help.
</p>
<p>
In the text window the standard output is returned, warnings, errors,
and other information is printed on the R console.
</p>
<p>
The info bar has five text fields which hold the following information:
The active data series, the active object, and optional test, fit and 
prediction objects.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
The Browser and GUI is still experimental and still under current 
development. Just try it ...
