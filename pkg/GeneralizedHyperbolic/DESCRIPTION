Description: This package provides functions for the hyperbolic and
        related distributions. Density, distribution and quantile
        functions and random number generation are provided for the
        hyperbolic distribution, the generalized hyperbolic
        distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and
        the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is
        provided for the hyperbolic distribution, including fitting of
        the hyperbolic to data.
