\description{
  Density function, distribution function, quantiles and
  random number generation for the normal inverse Gaussian distribution
  with parameter vector \code{param}. Utility routines are included for
  the derivative of the density function and to find suitable break
  points for use in determining the distribution function.

\details{
  The normal inverse Gaussian distribution has density
  \deqn{e^{\delta \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}}%
        \frac{\alpha \delta}{\pi \sqrt{\delta^2 + (x - \mu)^2}}%
        K_1(\alpha \sqrt{\delta^2 + (x - \mu)^2})%
        e^{\beta (x - \mu)}}{ %
        f(x) = exp(delta sqrt(alpha^2 - beta^2)%
        alpha delta/pi sqrt(delta^2 + (x - mu)^2)%
        K_1(alpha sqrt(delta^2 + (x - mu)^2))%
        exp(beta (x - mu))}


  where \eqn{K_1()}{K_1()} is the modified Bessel function of the
  third kind with order 1.

  A succinct description of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution is
  given in {Paolella} (2007). Because both of the normal inverse Gaussian
  distribution and the hyperbolic distribution are special cases of the
  generalized hyperbolic distribution (with different values of
  \eqn{\lambda}{lambda}), the normal inverse Gaussian distribution has
  the same sets of parameterizations as the hyperbolic distribution.
  And therefore one can use \code{hyperbChangePars} to interchange between
  different parameterizations for the normal inverse Gaussian distribution as
  well (see \code{hyperbChangePars} for details).

  Each of the functions are wrapper functions for their equivalent
  generalized hyperbolic distribution. For example, \code{dnig} calls
  \code{dghyp}.

  \code{pnig} breaks the real line into eight regions in order to
  determine the integral of \code{dnig}. The break points determining
  the regions are found by \code{nigBreaks}, based on the values of
  \code{small}, \code{tiny}, and \code{deriv}. In the extreme tails of
  the distribution where the probability is \code{tiny} according to
  \code{nigCalcRange}, the probability is taken to be zero. In the range
  between where the probability is \code{tiny} and \code{small}
  according to \code{nigCalcRange}, an exponential approximation to the
  hyperbolic distribution is used. In the inner part of the
  distribution, the range is divided in 4 regions, 2 above the mode, and
  2 below. On each side of the mode, the break point which forms the 2
  regions is where the derivative of the density function is
  \code{deriv} times the maximum value of the derivative on that side of
  the mode. In each of the 4 inner regions the numerical integration
  routine \code{\link[DistributionUtils]{safeIntegrate}} (which is a
  wrapper for \code{\link{integrate}}) is used to integrate the density
  \code{dnig}.

  \code{qnig} uses the breakup of the real line into the same 8
  regions as \code{pnig}. For quantiles which fall in the 2 extreme
  regions, the quantile is returned as \code{-Inf} or \code{Inf} as
  appropriate. In the range between where the probability is \code{tiny}
  and \code{small} according to \code{nigCalcRange}, an exponential
  approximation to the hyperbolic distribution is used from which the
  quantile may be found in closed form. In the 4 inner regions
  \code{splinefun} is used to fit values of the distribution function
  generated by \code{pnig}.  The quantiles are then found
  using the \code{uniroot} function.

  \code{pnig} and \code{qnig} may generally be expected to be
  accurate to 5 decimal places.

  Recall that the normal inverse Gaussian distribution is a special case
  of the generalized hyperbolic distribution and the generalized
  hyperbolic distribution can be represented as a particular mixture of
  the normal distribution where the mixing distribution is the
  generalized inverse Gaussian.  \code{rnig} uses this representation to
  generate observations from the normal inverse Gaussian distribution.
  Generalized inverse Gaussian observations are obtained via the algorithm of
  Dagpunar (1989).}

\value{
  \code{dnig} gives the density, \code{pnig} gives the distribution
  function, \code{qnig} gives the quantile function and \code{rnig}
  generates random variates. An estimate of the accuracy of the
  approximation to the distribution function may be found by setting
  \code{accuracy = TRUE} in the call to \code{pnig} which then returns
  a list with components \code{value} and \code{error}.

  \code{ddnig} gives the derivative of \code{dnig}.
