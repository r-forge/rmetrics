	* qqgig, ppgig defaults changed when calculating quantiles and
	probabilities to make them quicker and more reliable---very large
	tolerances used since differences won't be obvious in plots

	* pgig, qgig changed so that pgig uses incompleteBesselK from
	DistributionUtils, and qgig uses the two part split at the mode
	and then optionally a spline fit or integration

2010-08-04    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* nig functions added (dnig, pnig, qnig, rnig, nigFit,
	nigFitStart, etc)


2010-06-25    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* ghypParam recreated to avoid using ghypChangeParam which causes
	errors when building or checking

2010-06-22    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* pghyp, qghyp modified using split at the mode

	* plotShapeTriangle added so parameter values can be plotted on it
	in examples for ghypParam to give just one use

2010-06-20    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* nig functions added by Christine Dong: nigFit, nigFitStart, dqpr
	functions for nig, nigCalcRange, moments for the nig

	* gigFit and gigFitStart added to allow for fitting of the
	generalized inverse Gaussian. Plot, print and summary methods are
	included with the fitting routines.

	* gigParam added to allow testing of the generalized inverse Gaussian

	* ghypParam changed to give spread of values over the shape
	triangle


2010-02-09    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* GeneralizedHyperbolic version 0.2-0 created. Eliminated
	functions already in DistributionUtils and made depend on
	DistributionUtils
