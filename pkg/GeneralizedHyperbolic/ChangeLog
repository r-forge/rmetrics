	* plotShapeTriangle added so parameter values can be plotted on it
	in examples for ghypParam to give just one use

2010-06-20    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* nig functions added by Christine Dong: nigFit, nigFitStart, dqpr
	functions for nig, nigCalcRange, moments for the nig

	* gigFit and gigFitStart added to allow for fitting of the
	generalized inverse Gaussian. Plot, print and summary methods are
	included with the fitting routines.

	* gigParam added to allow testing of the generalized inverse Gaussian

	* ghypParam changed to give spread of values over the shape
	triangle


2010-02-09    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* GeneralizedHyperbolic version 0.2-0 created. Eliminated
	functions already in DistributionUtils and made depend on
	DistributionUtils
