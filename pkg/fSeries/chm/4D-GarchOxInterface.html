<h2>R Interface for Garch Ox</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A collection and description of functions to 
fit the parameters of an univariate time 
series to GARCH models interfacing the G@RCH
Ox Package. 
<br>
</p>
<p>
The family of GARCH time series models includes the following 
processes:
</p>

<table summary="Rd table">
<tr>
  <td align="right">1   </td>  <td align="left"> garch  </td>  <td align="left">  generalized AR conditional heteroskedastic models, </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="right"> 2   </td>  <td align="left"> egarch </td>  <td align="left">  exponential GARCH models, </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="right"> 3   </td>  <td align="left"> aparch </td>  <td align="left">  asymmetretic power ARCH models. </td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
garchOxFit(formula, data, cond.dist = c("gaussian", "t", "ged", "skewed-t"), 
    include.mean = TRUE, trace = TRUE, control = list(), title = NULL,
    description = NULL)
    
## S3 method for class 'garchOx':
print(x, digits, ...)
## S3 method for class 'garchOx':
summary(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'garchOx':
plot(x, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cond.dist</code></td>
<td>
a character string describing the distribution of innovations. 
By default the optimization is based on gaussian log likelihood 
parameter optimization denoted by "gaussian". Alternatively, a 
Student-t "t", a generalized error "sged", or a skewed
Student-t "skewed-t" can be chosen.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
a list of additional control parameters:<br>
<code>truncation</code> - the number of truncation points,by default
100, <br>
<code>xscale</code> - should the time series be scaled by the
standard deviation ?
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
an optional timeSeries or data frame object containing the variables 
in the model. If not found in <code>data</code>, the variables are taken 
from <code>environment(formula)</code>, typically the environment from which
<code>armaFit</code> is called. If <code>data</code> is an univariate series, then
the series is converted into a numeric vector and the name of the
response in the formula will be neglected.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>description</code></td>
<td>
a character string which allows for a brief description.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
the number of digits to be printed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
[garchFit] - <br>
formula object describing the mean and variance equation of the 
ARMA-GARCH/APARCH model. A pure GARCH(1,1) model is selected 
when e.g. <code>formula=~garch(1,1)</code>. To specify for example an 
ARMA(2,1)-APARCH(1,1) use <code>formula = ~arma(2,1)+apaarch(1,1)</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>include.mean</code></td>
<td>
should the mean be included? By default TRUE.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
an object of class <code>garchOx</code> as returned from the function
code{garchOxFit}.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>title</code></td>
<td>
a character string which allows for a project title.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>
a logical flag. Should the estimation process be ttraced? 
By default TRUE.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
an object of class <code>garchOx</code> as returned from the function
<code>garchOxFit</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
additional arguments to be passed to the <code>print</code>, 
<code>summary</code>, and <code>plot</code> methods.
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
<B>Ox Interface:</B>
<br> 
The function <code>garchOxFit</code> interfaces a subset of the functionality 
of the G@ARCH 4.0 Package written in Ox. 
G@RCH 4.0 is one of the most sophisticated packages for modelling 
univariate GARCH processes including GARCH, EGARCH, GJR, APARCH, 
IGARCH, FIGARCH, FIEGARCH, FIAPARCH and HYGARCH models. Parameters
can be estimated by approximate (Quasi-) maximum likelihood methods
under four assumptions: normal, Student-t, GED or skewed Student-t 
errors.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>About Ox:</B>
<br>
Ox (tm) is an object-oriented matrix language with a comprehensive 
mathematical and statistical function library. Many packages were 
written for Ox including software mainly for econometric modelling. 
The Ox packages for time series analysis and forecasting, Arfima,
Doornik and Ooms [2003], Garch, Laurent and Peters [2005], and State 
Space Modelling, Koopman, Shepard and Doornik [1998], are especially worth 
to note. Since most of the R-users wan't to change to another Statistical 
Computing environment, we made selected parts of the G@RCH Ox software 
available for them through an R-Interface. What you have to do, is 
to read carefully the "Ox citation and copyright" rules and if you
agree and fullfill the conditions, then download the OxConsole Software 
together with the "OxGarch" Package, currently G@RCH 4.0. If you are 
not qualified for a free license, order your copy from Timberlake 
Consultants. We recommend to install the "Setup.exe" under the path 
"C:\Ox\Ox3" and to unzip the OxGarch Package in the directory 
"C:\Ox\Ox3\Packages". An Update to Ox4 has not yet be done.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Distribution:</B>
<br>
Ox and G@RCH are distributed by Timberlake Consultants Ltd. Timberlake 
Consultants can be contacted through the following web site: 
<EM>www.timberlake.co.uk</EM>.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Installation of the Interface:</B>
<br>
In addition you have to copy the file "GarchOxModelling.ox" (which 
is the interface written especially for Rmetrics) from 
the "fSeries/ox/" directory to the Ox library directory 
"C:\Ox\lib".
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Ox Citation and Copyright Rules:</B>
<br>
Ox and all its components are copyright of Jurgen A. Doornik. The 
Console (command line) versions may be used freely for academic 
research and teaching purposes only. Commercial users and others 
who do not qualify for the free version must purchase the Windows 
version of Ox and GiveWin with documentation, regardless of which 
version they use (so even when only using Ox on Linux or Unix). 
Ox should be cited whenever it is used. Refer to the two references 
given below. Note, failure to cite the use of Ox in published work 
may result in loss of the right to use the free version, and an 
invoice at the full commercial price. Ox is available from Timberlake 
Consultants. The Ox syntax is public, and you may do with your own 
Ox code whatever you wish, including the file "GarchOxModelling.ox".
<br>
</p>
<p>
<B>Work to do:</B>
<br>
Note, only a small part of the functionalities are interfaced until
now to R. But, principally it would be possible to interface also other
functionalities offered by the Ox Garch Package. This work is left
to the Ox/Rmetrics user.
