INSTRUCTIONs on installing the Markov Switching Package

This markov swicthing package for R needs the use of a free source optimization library called Rdonlp2.

Such package can be found here:

http://arumat.net/Rdonlp2/

The rdnlop2 package is not available ar CRAN, meaning that when I submit the markov switching package to R-Forge, 
The site CANNOT build it like the other packages since it doesnt find the Rdnlop2 source files.
The consequence of it is that the library cannot be installed with:

install.packages("fMarkovSwitching",repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

given that the zip and tar files are not available.
I have been trying to fix it, but so far no sucess. 

But, there is a work around.

In the root of the package directory, there is a zip file called:

fMarkovSwitching_PROCEDURAL.zip

Such file contains all the functions of the library itself. And, the most important, example scripts for
using them. The steps for using it are:

1) download Rdonlp2 at http://arumat.net/Rdonlp2/
2) install it (in R console go to "packages" and then "install packages from local zip file..")
3) change the path (variable myPath) at the R examples scripts (e.g Example_MS_Regress_Fit.r) for where you unzipped the fMarkovSwitching_PROCEDURAL.zip file
4) run the scripts

If you need the help files, I also included the compiled help for the library (fMarkovSwitching.chm).
