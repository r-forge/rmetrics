(provided by Makoto Matsumoto and Mutsuo Saito) \n- mixed = TRUE for QMC sequences. \n\nNOTE FIX\n- usage of R_useDynamicSymbols to preclude compilation\nNOTEs, better registration of native routines and reduced\nsymbol visibility.\n\nVersion 1.17\n=============\n- change DESCRIPTION file.\n- update NAMESPACE for R 3.3.0.\n- update the LICENSE file.\n- raise a warning when scrambling for Sobol sequences is incorrect.\n\nBUG REPORT \n(by Dan Souther, Kemal Dincer Dingec, Marius Hofert, Nicolas Chopin)\n- scrambling = 1, 3 for Sobol sequences.\n(by Hiroyuki Kawakatsu)\n- mixed = TRUE for QMC sequences. \n\nVersion 1.16\n=============\n- change title and other minor things in vignettes.\n\nVersion 1.15\n=============\n\n- remove the use of 'long long' in some C code.\n- update LICENCE file.\n- move autoconf files to tools directory.\n- no longer use a4 paper format in vignette.\n\nVersion 1.14\n=============\n\n- change licence from BSD_2_clause to BSD_3_clause.\n- minor change.\n\nVersion 1.13\n=============\n\n- this version is one of the last versions working with\npackage rngWELL >= 0.11-0.\n- change licence from BSD to BSD_2_clause.\n\nNOTE FIX\n\n- remove NOTES appearing in R CMD check.\n\nVersion 1.12\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- add new test files.\n- increase the possible dimension of Halton sequences.\n\nWARNING FIX in Fortran files\n\n- remove an array over-run (reported by Brian Ripley) and tab \ncharacters in LowDiscrepancy.f.\n\n\nVersion 1.11\n=============\n\n- this version is one of the last versions working with\npackage rngWELL == 0.10-x.\n\nNOTES FIXES\n\n- this version use packageStartupMessage function for the .onAttach\nrather than the cat function. \n- remove a printf in KnuthTAOCP2002.c\n\nWARNING FIXES in C files\n\n- remove warnings with Wall and pedantic gcc options. For this\npurpose, files randtoolbox/src/Makevars and rngWELL/src/Makevars\nnow contain a line, uncommenting which includes Wall and pedantic.\n\nSee https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2008-August/005251.html\n\n\nBUG FIX\n- the package crashes when the dimension was 0 in RNG functions, \nreported by David LeBauer.\n\n\nVersion 1.10\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- update the man page pseudoRNG.Rd and quasiRNG.Rd with MT19937\nand other minor improvements.\n- on loading, the package print the overview man page.\n\nWARNING FIXES\n\n- fix some warnings following the release of R 2.13.0: \nthe Makefile and the man page of runifInterface.\n- fix a warning in the MT19937 file.\n\nBUG FIX\n\n- remove implicit type declaration in the LowDiscrepancy fortran file,\nwhich causes errors with GCC 4.6 compilers.\n\n\nVersion 1.09\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- start runif interface for congruential generator and WELL RNG,\n- vignette contains two chapters,\n- start to test true randomness (not included in this version),\n- increase the speed and accuracy of Halton and Sobol sequences.\n\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGE\n\n- Before version 1.09, there was a lot of different (and incompatible) \nlicences in this package, namely, GPL, BSD, public domain, etc... \n(cf. 1.08-version DESCRIPTION file of this package). \n- From 1.09, all this code of this package is under the new BSD licence. \nA copy of the BSD licence is available at \nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php\n- extract Pierre L'Ecuyer's code from randtoolbox and \nput it in a dedicated package rngWELL,\n- depends now on rngWELL.\n\nAUTHORS\n\n- all the code of this package except the ones listed below was written by Yohan Chalabi,\nChristophe Dutang, Petr Savicky and Diethelm Wuertz.\n- the code for SF-Mersenne Twister belongs to M. Matsumoto and M. Saito, \nwhich is under the new BSD licence. \n- the code for Knuth-TAOCP-2002 generator belongs to D. E. Knuth. \nThis code is in the public domain and freely copyable.\n\nBUG FIX\n\n- normal transformation of Halton and Sobol sequences is correct.\n\nBUG REPORT\n\n- Halton and Sobol sequences did not work on 64bit architecture when\nusing normal transformation reported by Anirban Mukherjee,\n- Sobol sequences for dimension > 2 need to be tested.\n\nVersion 1.08 (never released on CRAN)\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- add function get.primes,\n- table of primes moved from randtoolbox.c to primes.h and compressed\n  by storing half difference from the previous prime instead of each\n  prime (except for 2 and 3),\n- start runifinterface.\n\nVersion 1.07\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- integrate code for Halton, Sobol sequence from fBasics (Rmetrics),\n- randoolbox is now part of Rmetrics project (available on R-forge),\n- increase the speed of congruRand.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- fix setSeed function,\n- a warning shows up on 64 bit architecture.\n\nBUG REPORT\n\n- setting the seed with WELL's RNGs was not correct, \nreported by Petr Savicky.\n\nVersion 1.06\n=============\n\nBUG FIX\n\n- the degree of freedom is now correct for the order test.\n\nBUG REPORT\n\n- Astley Lin reports that the degree-of-freedom(df) of \nchi-square test is wrong for the order test.\n\nVersion 1.05\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- add new WELL generators based on L'Ecuyer's code,\n- add the Sobol and Halton sequences from fOptions package.\n\nBUG FIX\n\n- Yes, it compiles on 64bit linux both on CRAN and R-forge.\n\nVersion 1.04\n=============\n\nBUG REPORT\n\n- the package does not compil on Fedora 8 x86_64 boxes,\nreported by Brian Ripley.\n\n\nVersion 1.03\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- add the WELL generator thanks to the code of P. L'Ecuyer,\n- SFMT now allows for different mersenne exponents as well as parameter sets,\n- increase the possible dimension for Torus algorithm from 1000 to 100 000,\n- add the RAN_ARRAY generator of Knuth TAOCP (2002),\n- the function setRandSeed has be renamed by setSeed,\n- update the vignette.\n\n\nVersion 1.02\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- more random generation tests such as collision test and order test,\n- poker test is generalized to any dimension,\n- some auxiliary functions,\n- a detailed vignette on generating and testing random generation.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- on windows, when the seed was not fixed by the user, we use the machine\ntime. But we use only seconds of machine time not micro second like on \nunix-like system. Hence a call like this\n> for(i in 1:10) print(congruRand(1))\nproduces the same output. Now it is fixed.\n\nVersion 1.01 (never released on CRAN)\n=============\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n- add withtorus option for SFMT function,\n- improve output of tests.\n\n\nVersion 1.00\n=============\n\n- Initial release based on the torus package (which is no longer available).\n\n",
