	* dvg.R changed only code checking on nu, otherwise mine seemed
	newer compared to version in email 23/09/2009

	* vgFit.R changed following email from Christine 23/09/2009

	* vgChangePars.R updated following email from Christine 20/09/2009

	* check the man files: summary.vgFit.Rd, VarianceGamma.Rd,
	vgCalcRange.Rd, vgChangePars.Rd, vgCheckPars.Rd, vgFit.Rd,
	vgFitStart.Rd, vgParam.Rd, vgPlots.Rd, vgMom.Rd

2009-09-24    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* vgMom.R added to VarianceGamma/R

	* Started substituting functions from vg0.2-1 into current
	VarianceGamma

	vgParam.R, DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, dvg.R, summary.vgFit.R,
	vgCalcRange.R, vgChangePars.R, vgChangePars.R, vgCheckPars.R,
	vgFit.R, vgFitStart.R, vgMeanVarMode.R (was vgMomentsAndMode),
	vgPlots.R

	still need to check man files

2009-09-09    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* vgMomentsAndMode.R needs to have vgMom added and then to be
	updated. This code to come from vg0.2-1 submitted by
	Christine. Have already made some minor changes to this code.

2009-07-21    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* Checked code submitted by Christine: vgChangePars.R,
	vgChangePars.Rd, dvg.R, pvg.R, qvg.R, rvg.R ddvg.R, vgBreaks.R,
	VarianceGamma.Rd, vgFitStart.R, vgFitStartMoM.R (no apparent
	changes though), vgParam.R, vgParam.Rd, vgCheckPars.R, vgCheckPars.Rd

	* Changes submitted by Christine: For the R codes, the major
	changes from the current VG package is vgChangePars. And rvg,
	vgFitStart, dpqr were also changed a little according to
	vgChangePars and vgCheckPars. Data codes vgParam had some tiny
	changes around the names. And the moments codes are new to VG package.

	For the Rd codes, changes were made in vgChangePars,
	vgParam. Previous vgMomentsAndMode now have a new name as
	vgMVSKMode. Since I thought better to distinguish this one from
	vgMom. But if you could suggest me a better name, then I will edit
	it. Other Rd codes stayed about the same, except I added my email
	address in. And the moments Rd files are new. I think I corrected
	a typo in momChangeAbout.Rd, but nothing has been changed in
	momIntegrated or is.wholenumber.


2009-04-15    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* DESCRIPTION changed to add encoding UTF-8 * VarianceGamma.Rd,
	vgCalcRange.Rd, vgChangePars.Rd, vgFit.Rd, vgFitStart.Rd,
	vgMomentsAndMode.Rd all changed to drop space between \emph and {
	in Seneta reference, and to update all references to add encoding
	for Podgórski

2009-03-25    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* summary.vgFit.Rd
	Changed \code{\link{fitdistr}} to just\code{fitdistr} to avoid
	link not found error on R CMD Check
	* vgParam.Rd
	Added data(vgParam) statement in examples section to avoid error
	the smallParam was not found
