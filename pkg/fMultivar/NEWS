      Package fMultivar provides functions which might be useful 
      for the analysis and modeling of bivariate and multivariae 
      financial return distributions.

2014  The contributed Package "SN" has essently improved over the
      years. Therefore we have removed the "SN" builtin functions 
      for the density, probability, and random number generators.
      We recommend to call the functions directly from "SN". 

      Thus also the functions from *mvnorm, *mvt, and *mvstnorm are
      obsolete, they will no longer be supported.

      Conveniance wrappers for "SN" parameter estimation have been 
      added.

2013  Contributed Package "cubature" offers an adaptive integration
      function. We recommend to use this, the former builtin function 
      "adapt"" has become a wrapper for "cubature::adaptIntegrate.

      The compiled FORTRAN code provided in directory "src" is
      no longer required.

2012  We have added a NAMESPACE.

2007  The adapt Package has been removed from CRAN. A builtin function 
      with licensed FORTRAN Code fom Professor Genz has been implemented
      to fill this gap.

2005  The fMultivar was uploaded to CRAN.
