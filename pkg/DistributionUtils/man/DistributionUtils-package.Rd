\title{
  Utility functions useful for all distributions in packages following
  the standard approach developed in Scott, Wuertz and Dong.
}
\description{
  Functionality includes sample skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram,
  tail plots, moments by integration, changing the point about which a
  moment is calculated, functions for testing distributions using
  inversion tests and the Massart inequality. Also includes an
  implementation of the incomplete Bessel K function.  
}
\details{
Contains functions which are useful for packages implementing
distributions. Designed to work with my packages \pkg{GeneralizedHyperbolic},
\pkg{VarianceGamma}, \pkg{SkewHyperbolic} and \pkg{NormalLaplace}.
