Moran test needs unit test

Unit tests also needed for pDist and qDist, distMode,
distIneqMassartPlot (all to be done by Joyce)

Add contour plots and 3-D plots for fitted distributions

Add profile likelihoods for fitted distributions

Add simple wrapper functions for optimizers: see fitdistrplus

Sort data before using uniroot to find quantiles. Use algorithm which
takes this into account---Joyce??
