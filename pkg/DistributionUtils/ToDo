Moran test needs unit test

Unit tests also needed for pDist and qDist, distMode,
distIneqMassartPlot (all to be done by Joyce)

Add contour plots and 3-D plots for fitted distributions

Add profile likelihoods for fitted distributions

Add simple wrapper functions for optimizers: see fitdistrplus

Sort data before using uniroot to find quantiles. Use algorithm which
takes this into account---Joyce??

Inversion tests need to be checked to make sure that they deal with
distributions which are not on the whole real line, eg gig, but also
gamma, uniform etc

* Can we easily move  incompleteBesselK() [and the pure-R versions] to Bessel?

2017-10-28:  CRAN reports the following reverse dependencies:

Reverse depends: GeneralizedHyperbolic, NormalLaplace, SkewHyperbolic, VarianceGamma
Reverse imports: spectral.methods, trelliscope

The first four are also in Rmetric's R-forge:
- GeneralizedHyperbolic: --> uses incompleteBesselK (and more -- TODO: importFrom(.))
- NormalLaplace:  now has nice importsFrom(..): 9 fns, among which  besselRatio
- SkewHyperbolic: now has nice importsFrom(..): ca. 8 fns, among which  besselRatio
- VarianceGamma:  now has nice importsFrom(..): 8 fn, among which  besselRatio()

These *import* only, so we can see what they use (NAMESPACE, also checked R/*):

- spectral.methods: importFrom(DistributionUtils, logHist)
- trelliscope:      importFrom(DistributionUtils, skewness)
