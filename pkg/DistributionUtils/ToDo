Moran test needs unit test

Unit tests also needed for pDist and qDist, distMode,
distIneqMassartPlot (all to be done by Joyce)

Add contour plots and 3-D plots for fitted distributions

Add profile likelihoods for fitted distributions

Add simple wrapper functions for optimizers: see fitdistrplus

Sort data before using uniroot to find quantiles. Use algorithm which
takes this into account---Joyce??

Inversion tests need to be checked to make sure that they deal with
distributions which are not on the whole real line, eg gig, but also
gamma, uniform etc

distStepSize needs argument for the sample size needed for the median
estimation

Need to improve incomplete Bessel K calculation, add C++ code from Toby
