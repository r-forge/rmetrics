Description: Utilities which are of use in the packages I have developed
  for dealing with distributions. Currently these packages are
  GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic and NormalLaplace.
  Each of these packages requires DistributionUtils. Functionality includes
  sample skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots, moments by
  integration, changing the point about which a moment is
  calculated, functions for testing distributions using inversion
  tests and the Massart inequality. Also includes an implementation
  of the incomplete Bessel K function.
