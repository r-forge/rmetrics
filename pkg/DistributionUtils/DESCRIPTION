Description: This package contains utilities which are of use in the
	     packages I have developed for dealing with
	     distributions. Currently these packages are
	     GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma, and
	     SkewHyperbolic. Additional packages are under
	     development. Each of these packages requires
	     DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample skewness
	     and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots, moments by
	     integration, changing the point about which a moment is
	     calculated, functions for testing distributions using
	     inversion tests and the Massart inequality. Also includes
	     an implementation of the incomplete Bessel K function.
