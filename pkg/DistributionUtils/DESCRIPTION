Description: This package contains utilities which are of use in the
	     packages I have developed for dealing with
	     distributions. Currently these packages are
	     GeneralizedHyperbolic, VarianceGamma, and
	     SkewHyperbolic. Additional packages are under
	     development. Each of these packages requires
	     DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample skewness
	     and kurtois, log-histogram, and moments by integration.
