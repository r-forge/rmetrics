\title{Valuation of Currency Translated Options}


\description{
  
    This is a collection of functions to valuate currency 
    translated options. Currency translated options are 
    options on foreign assets where the payoff is exchanged 
    into domestic currency at expiration. For example, a US 
    investor is interested in buying an option that is linked 
    to the Nikkei index that is priced in yen. There are 
    two types or risks, changing prices and exchange rates, 
    to consider when valuing currency-translated options.

    The functions are:

    \bold{Equity Linked Foreign Exchange Options:}
    \cr\cr
    An equity-linked foreign-exchange option is an option on the foreign 
    exchange rate and is linked to the forward price of a stock or equity 
    index. This option can be priced analytically using a model introduced 
    by Reiner (1992).
    \cr
    
  
    \bold{Quanto Options:}
    \cr\cr
    A fixed exchange-rate foreign-equity option (Quanto) is denominated in 
    another currency than that of the underlying equity exposure. The face 
    value of the currency protection expands or contracts to cover changes 
    in the foreign currency value of the underlying asset. Quanto options 
    can be priced analytically using a model published by Dravid, Richardson, 
    and Sun (1993).
    \cr
    
    
    \bold{Foreign Equity Options:}
    \cr\cr
    A foreign equity option is an option on a foreign asset where the strike 
    price is specified in either domestic or foreign currency and the payoff 
    at expiration is valued in domestic currency. Foreign equity options 
    can be priced analytically using a model introduced by Reiner (1992).
    \cr
    
  
    \bold{Takeover Foreign Exchange Options:}
    \cr\cr
    A takeover foreign exchange call option gives the buyer the right purchase 
    a specified number of units of foreign currency at a strike price if the 
    corporate takeover is successful. This option can be priced analytically 
    using a model introduced by Schnabel and Wei (1994).
