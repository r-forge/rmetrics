\title{Valuation of Lookback Options}


\description{
  
    A collection and description of functions to valuate 
    lookback options. The payoff from a pathdependent 
    lookback call (put) depends on the exercise price 
    being set to the minimum (maximum) asset price achieved 
    during the life of the option. Thus, a lookback call 
    (put) allows the purchaser to buy (sell) the asset at 
    its minimum (maximum) price.

    The lookback call (put) option gives the holder the right to buy (sell) 
    an asset at its lowest (highest) price observed during the life of the 
    option. This observed price is applied as the strike price. The payout 
    for a call option is essentially the asset price minus the minimum spot 
    price observed during the life of the option. The payout for a put option 
    is essentially the maximum spot price observed during the life of the 
    option minus the asset price. Therefore, a floating strike lookback 
    option is always in the money and should always be exercised. Floating 
    strike options can be priced analytically using a model introduced by 
    Goldman, Sosin, and Gatto (1979). Monte Carlo simulation is used for 
    the numerical calculation of a European style floating strike options.

    \bold{Fixed Strike Lookback Options:}
    \cr\cr
    For a fixed strike lookback option, the strike price is known in advance. 
    The call option payoff is given by the difference between the maximum 
    observed price of the underlying asset during the life of the option and 
    the fixed strike price. The put option payoff is given by the difference 
    between the fixed strike price and the minimum observed price of the 
    underlying asset during the life of the option. A fixed strike lookback 
    call (put) option payoff is equal to that of a standard plain call (put) 
    option when the final asset price is the maximum (minimum) observed value 
    during the options life. Fixed strike lookback options can be priced 
    analytically using a model introduced by Conze and Viswanathan (1991).

    \bold{Partial-Time Floating Strike Options:}
    \cr\cr
    For a partial-time floating strike lookback option, the lookback period 
    starts at time zero and ends at an arbitrary date before expiration. 
    Except for the partial lookback period, the option is similar to a 
    floating strike lookback option. The partial-time floating strike 
    lookback option is cheaper than a similar standard floating strike 
    lookback option. Partial-time floating strike lookback options can be 
    priced analytically using a model introduced by Heynen and Kat (1994).
    \cr
    [Haug's Book, Chapter 2.9.3]
    \cr
  
    
    \bold{Partial-Time Fixed Strike Options:}
    \cr\cr
    For a partial-time fixed strike lookback option, the lookback period 
    starts at a predetermined date after the initialization date of the 
    option. The partial-time fixed strike lookback call option payoff is 
    given by the difference between the maximum observed price of the 
    underlying asset during the lookback period and the fixed strike 
    price. The partial-time fixed strike lookback put option payoff is 
    given by the difference between the fixed strike price and the 
    minimum observed price of the underlying asset during the lookback 
    period. The partial-time fixed strike lookback option is cheaper than 
    a similar standard fixed strike lookback option. Partial-time fixed 
    strike lookback options can be priced analytically using a model 
    introduced by Heynen and Kat (1994).

    \cr
  
    
    \bold{Extreme Spread Options:}
    \cr\cr
    The time to maturity of an extreme spread option is divided into two 
    periods: one period starting at time zero and ending at some arbitrary 
    date, and another starting at that arbitrary date and ending at the 
    expiration date. A payoff at maturity of an extreme spread call (put) 
    option equals the positive part of the difference between the maximum 
    (minimum) value of the underlying asset of the second (first) period 
    and the maximum (minimum) value of the underlying asset of the first 
    (second) period.[1] The payoff at expiration of a reverse extreme 
    spread call (put) option equals the positive part of the difference 
    between the minimum (maximum) of the underlying asset of the second 
    (first) period and the minimum (maximum) value of the underlying asset 
    of the first (second) period. Extreme spread options can be priced 
    analytically using a model introduced by Bermin (1996).
