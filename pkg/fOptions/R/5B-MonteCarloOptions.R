    # Description:
    #   Valuates Options by Monte Carlo Simulation

    # Arguments:
    #   delta.t    - The length of the time interval, by default one day.
    #   pathLength - Number of Time Intervals which add up to the path.
    #   mcSteps    - The number of Monte Carlo Steps performed in one loop.
    #   mcLoops    - The number of Monte Carlo Loops
    #   init       - Should the random number generator be initialized ?
    #                This variable must appear in the argument list of the
    #                random number generator, even it will not ne used
    #   innovations.gen 
    #              - the generator function for the innovations
    #   path.gen   - the generator for the MC paths
    #   payoff.calc
    #              - the payoff claculator function
    #   antithetic - if TRUE, antithetic paths are used in the MC simulation
    #   standardization
    #              - if TRUE, the random numbers will be standardized so that
    #                their mean is zero and their variance is zero
    #   trace      - a logical, should the iteration path be traced ?
    #   ...        - additional parameters passed to innovations.gen.
    
    # Notes:
    #   Global Variables:
    #     The options parameter must be globally available. 
    #     For a Black-Scholes or a simple Asian Option these are:
    #     TypeFlag, S, X, Time, r, b, sigma
    #   Required Functions:
    #     The user must specify the following functions:
    #     innovations.gen()
    #     path.gen()
    #     payoff.calc()
