Random simulation or Monte-Carlo methods rely on the fact we have access to random numbers. Even if nowadays having random sequence is no longer a problem, for many years producing random numbers was a big challenge. According to \cite{ripleybook}, simulation started in 1940s with physical devices. It brings us to a point we need to take care is the kind simulation we deal with. Using physical phenomena to get random numbers is referred in the literature as true randomness.
However in our computers we use more frequently pseudo-random numbers, which 
are defined as deterministic sequences, which mimic a sequence of
i.i.d. random numbers chosen from the uniform distribution on the interval
$[0,1]$ and have the same relevant statistical properties. Random number generators
used for this purpose receive as input an initial information, which is called a user
specified seed, and allow to obtain different output sequences of numbers from $[0,1]$
depending on the seed. If the user does not specify the seed, then it is obtained from
the machine time, i.e. the seed is computed with the seconds, miliseconds of the machine clock.



Since we use fake random numbers as a proxy for random numbers, one important question is the desired properties of RNG. \cite{ripleybook} lists the following properties
\begin{itemize}
\item output numbers are almost uniformly distributed,
\item output numbers are independent,
\item the period between two identical numbers is sufficiently long,
\item unless a seed is given, output numbers should be unpredictable.
\end{itemize}

The statistical software \soft{R} provides several random number generators described
in '?RNGkind()'. The default generator is called Mersenne-Twister and achieves high
quality. Still, there are reasons to provide better and more recent RNGs as well as classic statistical tests to quantify their property. The rest of this chapter is two-folded: first we present the use of RNGs through the \code{runif} interface, second we present the same use with dedicated functions.



\section{The \code{runif} interface}

In \soft{R}, the default setting for random generation are (i) uniform numbers are produced by the Mersenne-Twister algorithm and (ii) normal numbers are computing through the numerical inversion of the standard normal distribution function. This can be checked by the following code
%%% R code
<<check, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
RNGkind()
@
%%%
The function \code{RNGkind} can also be used to set other RNGs, such as Wichmann-Hill, Marsaglia-Multicarry, Super-Duper, Knuth-TAOCP or Knuth-TAOCP-2002 plus a user-supplied RNG. See the help page for details. The function \code{set.generator} eases the process to set a new RNG in \soft{R}.

To get back to the original setting of RNGs in \soft{R}, we just need to call \code{set.generator} with \code{default} RNG.
%%% R code
<<undo, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
library(randtoolbox)
RNGkind()
set.generator("default")
RNGkind()
@
%%%
