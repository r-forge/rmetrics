<h2>Resampled Portfolio Frontier</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A collection and description of functions to 
...
<br>
</p>
<p>
The functions are:
</p>

<table summary="Rd table">
<tr>
  <td align="left"><code>frontierResampled</code> </td>  <td align="left"> ... . </td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
frontierResampled(x = as.matrix(read.csv("nova-updated.csv", header = FALSE)),
    expectedReturns = read.csv("expected-returns.csv"), frequency = 52,
    control = list(nFrontier = 200, returnChoice = 2, covarianceChoice = 2,
    targetChoice = 6, correlationChoice = 1), confidenceLevel = TRUE, 
    trace = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
any rectangular multivariate time series object which can be
transformed into a matrix throught the function <code>as.matrix</code>. 
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>expectedReturns</code></td>
<td>
expectedReturns
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>frequency</code></td>
<td>
frequency of time series records. An integer value, by default
52 which denotes weekly data records.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
a control list with the following entries: ...
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>confidenceLevel</code></td>
<td>
a logical flag, if <code>TRUE</code> then 95
returned, otherwise not. By default <code>TRUE</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>
a logical if <code>TRUE</code> then the portfolio resampling process
will be ttraced, otherwise not. By default <code>TRUE</code>.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
I attach the code and some data (list of weekly returns of several
assets and list of possible expected returns; they have to be in the
same folder as the R script.
</p>
<p>
To get at least a glimpse at what is going on, one should be
familiar with the book  "Efficient Asset Management" by R. Michaud 
and the concept of resampled efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Stripped to the bones, the basic idea is to Monte-Carlo simulate the
returns of the assets in your portfolio (you sample a multivariate
distribution which is consistent with the "true" covariance matrix C
and the "true" vector of expected returns v you assume to describe
your portfolio) and generate many efficient frontiers.
</p>
<p>
Then one averages out of the simulated frontiers the weights of the
"statistically equivalent" portfolios. By using them in conjunction
with C and v one generates a resampled frontier which, compared to
Markowitz classical treatment, is sub-optimal by definition but is
numerically more robust (Markowitz is too sensitive to the hypothesis
of the problem) and leads to more diversified portfolios which make
investment sense.
</p>
<p>
I exchanged some emails with Michaud discussing some technicalities of
the method (of course up to a certain extent: there are two patents
pending).
</p>
<p>
A few issues need further thought, but that can be postponed for now.
Beside this, the code implements some shrinkage techniques for the
expected returns of the assets and the covariance matrix (Bayesian
statistics with different priors, see the works by Olivier Ledoit &amp;
Michael Wolf for the formulas).
</p>
<p>
Confidence levels coming from a re-interpretation of the research by
Jobson &amp; Korkie are implemented as in the book by Michaud.
