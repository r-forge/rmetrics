	* momRecursion.R, momRecursion.Rd, momChangeAbout.R,

	besselRatio.R, besselRatio.Rd, testbesselRatio.R, gigCheckPars.R,
	gigCheckPars.Rd, testgigCheckPars.R, moved to HyperbolicDist from

	* hyperbFitStart.Rd changed to take out {\o} and {\ae} in names
	and replace with \enc entries

	* All .Rd files changed where they contained a name with foreign
	accents. Encoding changed in description file as
	Encoding: latin1 and changed wherever possible Blaesild to
	\enc{BlÅÊsild}{Blaesild}, Cramer to \enc{CrÅ‰mer}{Cramer}, Jorgensen
	to \enc{JÅˆrgensen}{Jorgensen}, and Sorenson to
	\enc{SÅˆrenson}{Sorenson}

	* hyperbFit, print.hyperbFit, plot.hyperbFit, print.summary.hyperbFit:
	changed name of object in call from object to x to follow
	requirements for S3 generics. Changed name of data from x to obs
	and data name from xName to obsName to avoid conflict with x as
	name of object and of data
	* hyperbFit.Rd, summary.hyperbFit.Rd: documentation changed to
	reflect changes in functions
	* hyperbFit, hyperbFit.Rd: changed name of control list for
	Nelder-Mead from controlNLM to controlNM
	* summary.hyperbFit, summary.hyperbFit.Rd: changed Theta to
	object$Theta in two places on advice from Bernhard Pfaff since
	there was an error:
	Error in summary.hyperbFit(tmp) : object "Theta" not found
