Description: This package is no longer being maintained. It has been
	     superseded by GeneralizedHyperbolic. GeneralizedHyperbolic 
	     includes all the functionality of HyperbolicDist and more 
	     and is based on a more rational design. HyperbolicDist 
	     provides functions for the hyperbolic and related 
	     distributions. Density, distribution and quantile functions 
	     and random number generation are provided for the hyperbolic 
	     distribution, the generalized hyperbolic distribution, 
	     the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and the 
	     skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is 
	     provided for the hyperbolic distribution, including 
	     fitting of the hyperbolic to data.
