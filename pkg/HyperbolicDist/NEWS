VERSION 0.5-2

  o	Some bug fixes added which were causing Make Check to fail on
	Windows when tested using Uwe Ligges site. Problem was naming of
	objects as x conflicting with use of x as data.


VERSION 0.5-1

   o	Names changed to form with words after the initial one
	capitalized, e.g. log.pars becomes logPars. Applies to both
	function and variable names. Exceptions are functions for
	distributions (dhyperb, rgig, pskewlap), and KNu.

   o	Added functions for the skew-Laplace distribution: dskewlap,
	pskewlap, qskewlap and r skewlap.

   o	Added (xi, chi) parameterisation to those for which
	hyperbChangePars (which was hyperb.change.pars) can be used to
	interchange between parameterisations of the hyperbolic
	distribution.

  o	Added functions for the generalized hyperbolic distribution:
	dghyp, pghyp, qghyp, rghyp, ghypChangePars, ghypCalcRange, 
	ghypMean, ghypVar, ghypMode.

  o	Added functions for the generalized inverse Gaussian
	distribution: dgig, pgig, qgig, rgig1, rgig,
	gigChangePars,gigCalcRange, gigMean, gigVar, gigSkew, gigKurt,
	gigMode.

   o	Parameter vector name changed to Theta instead of theta so an
	individual component could be called theta.

  o	New algorithms developed for phyperb, pghyp, and pgig where
	numerical integrations are on sections of the real line. Developed
	to improve accuracy of numerical results.

  o	New algorithms for distribution functions use the derivative of
	the density and need break points to determine sections to
	integrate over. Derivative functions ddhyperb, ddghyp, ddgig, and
	break functions hyperbBreaks, ghypBreaks, gigBreaks developed.

  o	Functions for Cramer-von Mises goodness of fit test for the
	hyperbolic distribution added.
