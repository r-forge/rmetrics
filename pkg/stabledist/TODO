     ..  but the test times

     * checking tests ...  [173s/174s] OK
	Running doRUnit.R  [82s/83s]
	Running dstab-ex.R [34s/34s]
	Running pstab-ex.R [19s/19s]
	Running tails.R    [39s/39s]

     are more than we would like, so please consider reducing substantially
     next time around (but we can at least put on --no-tests where necessary).

     CRAN keeps on growing (more packages, many getting bigger) and our check
     farm does not (and nor do servers in general, although we can get more cores).


* Compare with Jim Lindsey's "stable" package
  --> http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html
  Maybe even ask him to make it CRANny
  (maybe after transfering maintainership ?)

  At SfS ETH: source in /usr/local/app/R/R_local/JimLindsey/stable/
  installed in          /usr/local/app/R/R_local/JimLindsey/library

* stableMode():  [MM] I'm pretty sure that the  'beta.max' argument is
  		 unneeded and could be eliminated.

* parametrizations -- pm=0, 1, 2 ---
  provide functions for the parameter transformation that go from
  other to pm=0 -- and back
  and then show how to, or  use these to to provide thransformations
  from all pm's to any other.

* [qp] check the  lower.tail & log.p argument settings
  NB: This check *should* happen in  fBasics  'checkdist' ...
