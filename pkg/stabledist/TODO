* Compare with Jim Lindsey's "stable" package
  --> http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html
  Maybe even ask him to transfer maintainership and make it CRAN-y ?
  (at SfS ETH: source in /usr/local/app/R/R_local/JimLindsey/stable/
   installed in          /usr/local/app/R/R_local/JimLindsey/library )

* stableMode():  [MM] I'm pretty sure that the  'beta.max' argument is
  		 unneeded and could be eliminated.

* parametrizations -- pm=0, 1, 2 ---
  provide functions for the parameter transformation that go from
  other to pm=0 -- and back
  and then show how to, or  use these to to provide thransformations
  from all pm's to any other.
