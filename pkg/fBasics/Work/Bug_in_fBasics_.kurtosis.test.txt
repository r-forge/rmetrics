*Subject:* Bug in fBasics .kurtosis.test function____

__ __

Hello Georgi,____


I am building a Shiny app that uses the fBasics dagoTest function and
found that a particular data set did not get a result for the kurtosis
test. I dug into the code and found the issue within the internal
.kurstosis.test function, particularly in this line:

pos=((1-2/A)/(1+U4*sqrt(2/(A-4))))^(1/3)____

__ __

In my case, I had a data set that resulted in a negative value
for ((1-2/A)/(1+U4*sqrt(2/(A-4)))) and attempting to take the cubic root
of a negative this way returns NaN.  ____

__ __

The easiest solution would be to do something along the lines of
sign(x)*abs(x)^1/3. Once I did that with your function, I was able to
verify the result against a different software.____

__ __

I am including a sample data set that you can use to reproduce the
error. Hope that helps!____

Thanks,____
