Also fBasics: _R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_ is now part of check
--as-cran.

These are not portable: the pdf() and postscript() devices only support
characters in an 8-bit locale, usually Latin-1, and R CMD check uses
pdf(), on CRAN in a Western European UTF-8 locale where pdf() uses
Latin-1.  In most cases you should be using plotmath ....

Checking with environment varianble _R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_
set to a non-empty value will throw an error in current R-devel,
although you can also grep the .Rcheck directory for 'conversion
failure.*mbcsToSbcs'

Attempts to plot Greek letters on a pdf() device are seen in the checks
of packages

Plotmath can also be used for ∞ (utilities) ≤ (autoReg, brr, ggstats,
visualize) and ≥ (simulariatools, visualize). Some versions of R will
transliterate to e.g. <= or >= rather than substitute '.' but the use of
plotmath will look better.

NB: the issues will not be seen on a platform whose libiconv does
transliteration -- known are macOS 14 and Alpine Linux.  But for example
on macOS 14, the missing Greek symbols are silently substituted by ?,
which is not useful.

[The cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() devices handle fonts differently and can
plot a wider (but platform-dependent) range of Unicode chars. It looks
like using plotmath will suffice, but if not you could arrange for your
examples/tests to use cairo_pdf() if dev.cur() shows the current device
is pdf().]

Please correct before 2023-11-14 to safely retain your package on CRAN.
