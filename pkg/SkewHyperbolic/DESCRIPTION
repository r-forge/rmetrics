Description: Functions are provided for the density function,
	     distribution function, quantiles and random number generation 
	     for the skew hyperbolic t-distribution. There are also 
	     functions that fit	the distribution to data. There are functions 
	     for the mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and mode of a given 
	     distribution. To assess goodness of fit, there are also 
	     functions to generate a Q-Q plot and a P-P plot.
