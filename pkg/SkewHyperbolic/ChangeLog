	* version changed to 0.3-2

	* testskewhypTailPlotLine.R changed to have a fixed seed when
	simulating data, at request of CRAN maintainers

2012-04-13    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* version changed to 0.3-1

	* test.qskewhyp changed to level2test.qskewhyp in unitTests
	because of intermittent failures

2010-03-31    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* Version updated to 0.3-0

	* skewhypParam introduced to enable unit testing. Unit tests
	developed for pskewhyp, qskewhyp and skewhypCalcRange

	* pskewhyp, qskewhyp totally altered to try and improve numeric
	performance. Extra arguments added to allow specification of
	tolerances in calls to integrate and uniroot. Integration to be
	carried out from infinity closer to value than mode and
	complementation used. lower.tail argument honoured.

	* skewhypCalcRange changed to refer to probability, not density
	skewhypStepSize introduced to step out properly in long tail

	* NAMESPACE changed to export all with 'skewhyp'

	* Depends changed to DistributionUtils and
	GeneralizedHyperbolic. Version 0.2-0 completed.

	* SkewHyperbolic updated to 0.1-3

	* ais (Australian Institute of Sport) data set added. Taken from
	package sn

	* plot.skewhypFit: dots added to curve function calls so
	parameters can be supplied (e.g. n, the number of points)

	* ppskewhyp and qqskewhyp subtitle default changed to match those
	for hist and logHist (param = (parameter values vector))
