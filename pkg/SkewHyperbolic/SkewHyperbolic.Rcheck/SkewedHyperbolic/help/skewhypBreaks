_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Utility routines that calculate suitable breakpoints for use in
     determining the distribution function, and the derivative of the
     density function.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: Vector of quantiles

      mu: Location parameter mu, default is 0.

   delta: Peakedness parameter delta, default is 1.

    beta: Skewness parameter beta, default is 1.

      nu: Shape parameter nu, default is 1.

   param: Specifying the parameters as a vector of the form 'c(mu,
          delta, beta, nu)'.

   small: Size of a small difference between the distribution function
          and 0 or 1.

    tiny: Size of a tiny difference between the distribution function
          and 0 or 1.

   deriv: Value between 0 and 1 which determines the point at which the
          value of the derivative becomes substantial compared to its
          maximal value, see *Details*.

     log: Logical; if 'log = TRUE', probabilities are given as log(p).

tolerance: Specified level of tolerance when checking if parameter beta
          is equal to 0 in 'ddskewhyp'.

     tol: Tolerance used in 'skewhypCalcRange', see *Details*.

     ...: Passes additional arguments to 'uniroot'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     'ddskewhyp' gives the derivative of 'dskewhyp'.

     'skewhypBreaks' returns a list with components: 

   xTiny: Value such that the probabilities to the left are less than
          'tiny'.

  xSmall: Value such that probabilities to the left are less than
          'small'.

lowBreak: Point to the left of the mode such that the derivative of the
          density at that point is 'deriv' times its maximum value on
          that side of the mode.

highBreak: Point to the right of the mode such that the derivative of
          the density at that point is 'deriv' times the value of the
          maximum value on that side of the mode.

  xLarge: Value such that the probabities to the right are less than
          'xSmall'.

   xHuge: Value such that probability to the right is less than 'tiny'.

modeDist: The mode of the given skewed hyperbolic distribution,
          calculated by 'skewhypMode'.


     'skewhypCalcRange' returns the quantile values at the endpoints of
     the region of the density function where the probablity is greater
     than 'tol'.
